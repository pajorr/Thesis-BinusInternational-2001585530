# Programming-Project---RMIT
Adrian, Ayrton, Dylan, Yonas

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# Git console commands probably needed to know
Git Base
- git fetch | fetches all from the git repo
- git pull  | pulls all files from git repo
- git status | list which files are staged, unstaged and untracked
Git Branches
- git branch | checks current branches
- git checkout -b "branch" | creates new branch
- git checkout "branch" | changed to "branch"
---- YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS FOR THE FIRST PUSH OF DEVELOPMENT BRANCH ----
- git push --set-upstream origin development
Git Push
- git add . | adds all files for a commit change the . to the directory with a file to change a specific file
- git commit -m "(message)" | commits after you add
- git push | pushes the commit


# If Git Development is ahead
If git development is ahead of development use the following command
- git pull origin development
